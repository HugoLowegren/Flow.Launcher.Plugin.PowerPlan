Flow.Launcher.Plugin.PowerPlan
====================
quickly switch between power plans

This is a fork of ![Wox.Plugin.PowerPlan](https://github.com/caoyue/Wox.Plugin.PowerPlan) but modified to work with ![FlowLauncher](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher). All credit goes to the original author, i merely updated the Plugin.dll and changed Wox strings to Flow.Launcher.
